# EuroCopa 2020

I have created a dashboard with the main statistics from the olayers and teams that took part of the 2020 Eurocopa. You will be able to select a team or players and compare their statistics, but also to select one of them and check all of the individual statistics. 


## How did we created? 

- Clone our repository to work on it. 
- Create 3 main folder where we will divide all of the information we will be working on. 
- First Folder: DATA (Where we cleaned up all of the data that we were going to use for our ddbb)
- Second Folder: API. (Where we defined the endpoitns and created the conexion with the ddbb).
- Third Folder: SREAMLIT (Conextion between ddbb and API to receive information and visualization of it)
