# Midtermproject

The midproject is based on Data from Euro 2020. The idea is to have an idea of general information about the players and events that each of them had and then also wide information about the teams. 

<h2> GOAL <H2/>
    
    - [] Create an API: Define end poits and quary parameters. Connect this to our DDBB
    - [] Create a Dashboard in Streamlit and prepare visualization parameters
    - [] Service conection 
    
    
<h2> STEPS <H2/>
    
    1. Clean data from CSV, many data are strings or have spaces useless which will make our data base not to be usefull and we need to transform to the right type in order to make easier future operations. 
    2. Create functions to collect information that we will use in the future dashboard
