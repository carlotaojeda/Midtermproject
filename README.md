# EuroCopa 2020

I have created a dashboard with the main statistics from the olayers and teams that took part of the 2020 Eurocopa. You will be able to select a team or players and compare their statistics, but also to select one of them and check all of the individual statistics. 


## How did we created? 

- Clone our repository to work on it. 
- Create 3 main folder where we will divide all of the information we will be working on. 
- First Folder: DATA (Where we cleaned up all of the data that we were going to use for our ddbb)
- Second Folder: API. (Where we defined the endpoitns and created the conexion with the ddbb).
- Third Folder: SREAMLIT (Conextion between ddbb and API to receive information and visualization of it)
  
    
    
## What can we find on the dashboard?

On the dashboard we can find the home page where we explain what can you find on this dashboard. If you follow the instructions you will be able to select from the left bar the view you want to check and the data you are interested to find from Euro2020.

Selecting a page from the left bar you will be able to find:

-  Look for each player's statistics.
